# Ch 4 multi layer perceptron

- to know about overfitting , underfitting
- regularisation
- creating deep neural networks more than one layer big

# Multi layer perceptron

- Hidden layers - if only one layer of affine solutions is needed for describing the model, then that would be sufficient.
- why activations
![](why_activations.png)

We need activations in between because otherwise the layers would collapse into a linear transformation.

with activations we have,

`H = sigma(XW1 + B1)`
`O = HW2 + B2`

# universal approximators
