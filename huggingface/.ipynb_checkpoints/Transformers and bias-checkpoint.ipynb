    "une 2018: GPT, the first pretrained Transformer model, used for fine-tuning on various NLP tasks and obtained state-of-the-art results\n",
    "\n",
    "October 2018: BERT, another large pretrained model, this one designed to produce better summaries of sentences (more on this in the next chapter!)\n",
    "\n",
    "February 2019: GPT-2, an improved (and bigger) version of GPT that was not immediately publicly released due to ethical concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "October 2019: DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT that is 60% faster, 40% lighter in memory, and still retains 97% of BERTâ€™s performance\n",
    "\n",
    "October 2019: BART and T5, two large pretrained models using the same architecture as the original Transformer model (the first to do so)\n",
    "\n",
    "May 2020, GPT-3, an even bigger version of GPT-2 that is able to perform well on a variety of tasks without the need for fine-tuning (called zero-shot learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "Distilbert is really small compared to others."
