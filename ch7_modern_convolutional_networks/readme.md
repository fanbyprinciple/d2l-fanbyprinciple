# Ch7 Mordern Convolutional Networks

* we would be using multiple architectures and implementing it

* reason for the growth - 1. good dataholding capacity 2. good gpu

## Alexnet

- won the image recognition contest in 2012 with a phenomenal margin.

- Here, we use a larger 11 x 11 window to capture objects. At the same
time, we use a stride of 4 to greatly reduce the height and width of the
