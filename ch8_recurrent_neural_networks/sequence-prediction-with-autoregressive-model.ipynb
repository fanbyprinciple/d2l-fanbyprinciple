This makes it intractable.Much about autoregressive model revolves around doing it efficiently. this is done by\n\n1. Not haveing arbitary long input, instead focus on someprevious tau values. Now this makes regression possible. They literally regress on themselves thus autoregressive model.\n\n2. second strategy is to keep tabs on some past observations through summary summary $h_t$ of the past observations, and at the same time update $h_t$ in addition to the prediction $\\hat{x}_t$.\nThis leads to models that estimate $x_t$ with $\\hat{x}_t = P(x_t \\mid h_{t})$ and moreover updates of the form  $h_t = g(h_{t-1}, x_{t-1})$.

One typically uses historical observations to predict the next observation given the ones up to right now. Obviously we do not expect time to stand still. However, a common assumption is that while the specific values of $x_t$ might change, at least the dynamics of the sequence itself will not.
